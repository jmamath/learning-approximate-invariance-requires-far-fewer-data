## Experiment: Stability of invariance inducing techniques on generalization gains
Just run the code launch.py
it will require all the scripts

## Experiment: Sample size and augmentation factor
Available in the notebook: Sample_size_and_augmentation_factor.ipynb

## Experiment: Effect of invariance inducing technique on uncertainty
Available in the notebook: Estimate_Uncertainty.ipynb,
We use the models trained when learning invariance with MNIST on EMNIST.

## Dependencies
Pytorch 1.4
